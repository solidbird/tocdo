# General
* make it a very heavy CLI tool
** focus on using it quick over command line
** not too much other stuff with gui etc
* send emails for each todo
** might need a deamon?
** send on demand?
** implement cronjob within the C code
** have settings options for this stuff maybe?
* maybe implement todo.txt syntax but with some added stuff
